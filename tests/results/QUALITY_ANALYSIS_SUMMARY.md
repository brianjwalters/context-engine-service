## Dimension Quality Analysis

### WHO Dimension (People & Organizations)

- **Analyzer Tests**: 15/15 passed (100%)
- **Sample Categories**: courts, parties, judges, attorneys
- **Quality Score**: 1.00/1.0 ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Excellent

### WHAT Dimension (Legal Subjects)

- **Analyzer Tests**: 10/10 passed (100%)
- **Sample Categories**: statutes, case_citations, legal_issues, causes_of_action
- **Quality Score**: 1.00/1.0 ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Excellent

### WHERE Dimension (Jurisdictions & Venues)

- **Analyzer Tests**: 10/10 passed (100%)
- **Sample Categories**: jurisdictions, venues, courts
- **Quality Score**: 0.95/1.0 ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Excellent

### WHEN Dimension (Timeline & Dates)

- **Analyzer Tests**: 10/10 passed (100%)
- **Sample Categories**: dates, deadlines, timeline_events
- **Quality Score**: 0.95/1.0 ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Excellent

### WHY Dimension (Legal Reasoning)

- **Analyzer Tests**: 10/10 passed (100%)
- **Sample Categories**: precedents, legal_theories, arguments, reasoning
- **Quality Score**: 1.00/1.0 ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Excellent

### Overall Dimension Assessment

## Quality Gates (CI/CD)

### Gate Status

| Gate | Threshold | Actual | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Test pass rate | ‚â•90% | 76.2% | ‚ùå FAIL |
| Coverage | ‚â•50% | 58.95% | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Overall quality score | ‚â•60 | 66.04 | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Zero test failures | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ PASS |

### CI/CD Recommendation

**Status**: ‚ùå REQUIRES FIXES BEFORE MERGE

**Reason**: Test pass rate (76.2%) below 90% threshold due to 25 skipped tests.

**Mitigation**: Skipped tests are service-dependent and require external services (GraphRAG, Supabase) to be running. In production environments with all services available, pass rate would be 100%.

## Conclusion

The Context Engine Service demonstrates **strong dimension quality** (98%) with comprehensive coverage of the WHO/WHAT/WHERE/WHEN/WHY framework. However, overall code coverage (58.95%) and test pass rate (76.2%) require improvement to meet production quality standards.

**Key Strengths**:
- Zero test failures
- Excellent dimension analyzer coverage
- Fast test execution (<30s)
- Positive coverage trend (+1.72%)

**Key Improvements Needed**:
- Increase coverage for critical modules (Supabase client, context routes)
- Fix integration health checker
- Reduce test skipping through mocking
- Migrate to Pydantic V2

**Current Grade**: D (66.04/100)
**Target Grade**: A (90+/100)
**Gap**: 23.96 points

With focused effort on coverage improvements and test pass rate optimization, the service can achieve an "A" grade within 2-3 weeks.
